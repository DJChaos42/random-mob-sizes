# Random Mob Sizes
This data pack randomly resizes mobs when they spawn in. Mobs can be larger or smaller than normal based on a percentage chance.

Any mob in the "c:scalable_mobs" entity tag will be affected by the pack. Players are exempt from being resized.

By default, the following mobs will be resized:
- Chicken
- Cow
- Pig
- Sheep
- Creeper
- Enderman
- Skeleton
- Spider
- Zombie
